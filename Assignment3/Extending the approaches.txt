Extending the approaches

1. We could clean the dataset by converting all letters to lower case and remove stopwords and irrelevant whitespaces. 
2. Tokenize the words in a sentence and use word embeddings like glove 
3. We could use count vectors or TF-IDF as features
4. In RNN we could use Bi-directional LSTM
